      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;overview&#34;&gt;overview&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;a fastapi-powered backend that automates the entire cold-emailing process for job applications. it handles scraping job info to generating and sending emails. i connected it to a google sheets app script and it runs locally with an ngrok tunnel to interact with from the browser for the apps script.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;you start by pasting a linkedin job link into the sheet and the system kicks off a playwright script that scrapes the company name, job title, and job description. after this a separate playwright worker searches bing for recruiter or hiring manager profiles at the company (e.g. “recruiters at {company_name} site:linkedin.com”), finds the most relevant result, and adds that link to the sheet.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;overview&#34;&gt;overview&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;got into lifting over winter break and i always thought something like this existed but didn&amp;rsquo;t see anything so i just got to building. solves the (somewhat nonexistent) problem of using too many plates to lift the same weight.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;for example, if you wanted to lift 135 lbs using a 45lb barbell, would you use two 25lb plates and four 10lb plates, or would you simply use two 45lb plates (one on each end)?&lt;/p&gt;</description>
