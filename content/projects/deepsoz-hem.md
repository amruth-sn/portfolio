## overview

over the course of jan 2024 - march 2025, i worked on improving, building, and ultimately evaluating an epileptic seizure detection algorithm using "DeepSOZ: A Robust Deep Model for Joint Temporal and Spatial Seizure Onset Localization from Multichannel EEG Data" (Shama, et al., MICCAI 2023) as a baseline model.

## people
a big thank you to Dr. Archana Venkataraman and Deeksha Shama for working with me over this year. they taught me so much  content-wise (that i never learned in any classes) but more specifically the process of iterating over an end-to-end research project itself.
