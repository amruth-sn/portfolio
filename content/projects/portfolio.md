## overview

started off as a react.js page with email.js integration, but then i realized i wasn't important enough for that to have any real effect.

found out about Hugo, a Golang-based static site generator. i'm typing this out on it, hence the "meta"-aspect. definitely feels a lot smoother for something like a portfolio page, without all of the extra overhead (apart from installing themes...)
